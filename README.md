### Welcome to my Github README

Github is mostly my base ground where I primarily manage my version-controlled, farm-managed, symlinked dotfiles.\
There is also a compact and curated list of my linux/freebsd tutorials, tools, and config files.\
Topics on my list are stack related and not MECE:

- [Symlink farm manager](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) | [Github Dotfiles Repo](https://www.github.comg/) | etc.
- [ZFS on FreeBSD](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs/) | [Zabbix Monitoring](https://www.zabbix.com/)
